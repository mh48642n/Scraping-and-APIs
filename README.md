# Scraping-and-APIs

## Purpose of Repo
As most of my projects revolve around macroeconomic projects it would prompt me to use the numerous
government apis and surveys that are aviable to perform tests of causal inference.

Unfortunately, as some of you may already know, the documentation for many of these APIs are less than subpar. So,
to make my life easier, and maybe yours, I am attempting to document the major series for bls, bea and specifically the
census bureau's M3 manufacturing survey.

If you want to use the code or sheets please go right ahead and if you have any tips on how I would better optimize the
code I would be welcome to suggestions!

The bls_survey_codes workbook contains the scraped bls codes
